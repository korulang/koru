# ECS Surface Benchmark

This is a small harness for comparing Bevy ECS against a static Zig baseline for
the parts of ECS that matter to Koru's intended execution model. It is
intentionally plain: each binary emits one JSON line per run.

## Scenarios

- `spawn`: spawn entities one at a time.
- `spawn_batch`: batch spawn entities.
- `despawn`: despawn all entities.
- `add_remove`: add and remove a marker component/flag.
- `query_get`: random-access entity/component lookup.
- `dense`: all entities have position and velocity; update all positions.
- `sparse`: 10% active entities; update only active entities.
- `schedule_empty`: run an empty scheduled system/function.
- `fanout`: damage events mutate health, then observer-style work fans out.
- `combat_world`: a deterministic console simulation with enemies, projectiles,
  spatial buckets, movement, collision, damage, death, and fanout bookkeeping.
- `bevy_strength_world`: packed dense archetypes with dynamic bodies,
  particles, orbiters, modular systems, command cleanup, changed-component
  checksum, and math-heavy iteration. This is intended to favor Bevy ECS.
- `archetype_churn_world`: Bevy-only anchor that moves entities between
  archetypes during the workload: `Idle`, `Seeking`, `Attacking`, `Stunned`,
  and `Dead`. It uses `Commands` for component insert/remove, real queries over
  changing marker/component sets, health changes, and a deterministic checksum.

The Zig baseline is not the final Koru implementation. It is the straight-line
shape Koru should generate for static storage, indexed sparse work, lifecycle
operations on static arrays, and fused reactive fanout.

## Run

```sh
./run.sh
```

To run only the Bevy archetype-migration anchor:

```sh
./run_bevy_anchor.sh
```

To run the matching Flecs anchor:

```sh
./run_flecs_anchor.sh
```

To run the matching Unity DOTS anchor, install/open with Unity 6 and set
`UNITY` if the executable is not in the default location:

```sh
UNITY=/path/to/Unity ./run_unity_dots_anchor.sh
```

The Rust/Bevy benchmark needs Cargo to fetch `bevy_ecs` on first run. The Zig
baseline has no external dependencies.
